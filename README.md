### Overview

OCoR is a Maya plug-in that implements the Optimized Centers of Rotation skinning (OCoR), a technique superior to Maya's default Classic Linear (LBS), Dual Quaternion (DQS), and Weight Blended (LBS+DQS) skinning methods, allowing more realistic posing and animations. Our implementation is based on the paper _Real-time Skeletal Skinning with Optimized Centers of Rotation_, Binh Huy Le, Jessica K. Hodgins, SIGGRAPH 2016. This plug-in is our final authoring tool project for the course CIS 6600 at Penn, and it was developed by Deze Lyu and Qichao Lin and supervised by Dr. Stephen H. Lane.
